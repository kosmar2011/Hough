Hough Transform in C for Catapult HLS (Bit Accurate data types to be implemented...)

For the algorithm to work correctly you need to perform Canny Edge Detection in the image first. I do that with Matlab and I specify on which image I perform the algorithm in run.sh. 

For now, just the algorithm works.
